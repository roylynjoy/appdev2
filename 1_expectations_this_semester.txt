1. Introduction (100-150 words)
	I am Roylyn Dicdican, a girl who loves to learn new knowledge, unlearn the wrong perception, and be willing to be corrected. When it comes to programming, I am not that knowledgeable; I am more interested in designing, but I also have the willingness inside me to study and improve. In terms of backend development, I do not have experience in using Node.js, but I am familiar with it. I have seen it on many platforms when I am scrolling on social media and searching about technologies, but I do not remember the exact scenario, videos, or context of it.

2. Course Expectations (200-300 words)
	My primary aim is to transition into backend development and broaden my perspective in this field. I also wish to gain new knowledge while improving and enhancing my skills. I hope to learn how to efficiently and effectively build APIs, as well as accurately use even more backend technologies like Node.js and Express. Moreover, I intend to learn more about how to manage the database, server-side scripting, and performance tuning, which are essentials in developing scalable and safe applications.
	The knowledge that I gain from this course and its practical application will greatly benefit me both academically and career-wise. As a central part of software engineering, backend development is something I aspire to become proficient in so that I am able to create full-stack applications that effectively manage data and user interactions. I believe this, alongside other web development knowledge, will help me gain employment opportunities as a software engineer or a cloud computing specialist, which are quite plentiful in this age of technology. 
	At the end of the day, I wish to incorporate the gained knowledge into reality, whether it be in work, an internship, or even personal projects. I am committed to staying curious and motivated to continually improve, always seeking to enhance my proficiency in backend technologies.

3. Challenges and Areas for Improvement (150-200 words)
	One area I find challenging is creating logic for backend systems and handling errors effectively. I often struggle with designing efficient logic and ensuring that errors are properly managed to avoid issues in production. It is quite difficult on my part to identify the errors; that is why I want to improve my ability to write clean, efficient logic while implementing robust error handling mechanisms.
	To overcome these challenges, I plan to apply the knowledge and skills I gain from this course directly to practice. I will focus on learning best practices for error handling and debugging and work on building APIs and integrating them with databases to strengthen my understanding. By completing hands-on projects and seeking feedback from instructors and peers, I aim to gain practical experience and build confidence in my problem-solving abilities. My goal is to gradually improve through consistent practice and continuous learning, making these tasks more intuitive and manageable.

4. Expectations from the Instructor (100-150 words)
	What I am expecting from you, sir, is that you will be able to catch the interest of each and every one of us and encourage us to work on our weaknesses in terms of programming. I hope that you will help us enhance our skills and build our confidence to strive for more knowledge. Offering tutorials, supplementary resources, or even suggesting useful tools would greatly enhance our learning experience, allowing us to expand our knowledge and become proficient in the subject matter. These resources would allow us to gain a better understanding of the material and create an engaging learning environment that supports our success in this course.
