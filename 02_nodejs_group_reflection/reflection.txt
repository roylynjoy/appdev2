I was assigned to be one of the developers in our group. During the implementation of our project, I learned a lot, specifically in the field of development. I learn at least the basics of how to find, understand, and fix bugs. I was happy to share my skills with my teammates even though we face a lot of struggles, challenges, and stress together. There are a lot of times that we are struggling because of our situations, but with God's help and mercy, we are able to accomplish it. As a developer, I want to improve my skills, God willing, by always practicing what I have learned and searching for more resources that will help me broaden my knowledge and always be ready for improvements.
